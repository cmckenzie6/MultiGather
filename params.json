{"name":"MultiGather","tagline":"Automatically switch between Find Herbs and Find Minerals.","body":"### What is MultiGather?\r\nMultiGather is an addon for World of Warcraft that automatically switches between the Find Herbs and Find Minerals skill every three seconds. It's very helpful when leveling or farming both professions simultaneously.\r\n\r\n### Specifications\r\nMultiGather was created specifically for World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King patch 3.3.5a (version 12340). However, it should be compatible with all WoW patches that support Interface 30300 (patches 3.3.0 through 3.3.5a).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it may work in more recent patches beyond 3.3.5a by checking \"Enable Out of Date Addons\". However, there is no guarantee.\r\n\r\nIf there is demand for compatibility with another patch, an update may be developed.\r\n\r\n### How Do I Install MultiGather?\r\n1. Click \"Download\" at the top to download MultiGather.zip\r\n2. Unzip the downloaded file to a location on your computer. You should have a folder called MultiGather with two files inside: `MultiGather.lua` and `MultiGather.toc`.\r\n3. Copy the MultiGather folder into your WoW Addons folder (`/World of Warcraft/Interface/Addons/`)\r\n4. Run World of Warcraft and log in to your account.\r\n5. At the character screen, click the Addons button in the bottom left and make sure MultiGather is checked. If you are not using World of Warcraft patch 3.3.5a, make sure you check \"Load out of date addons\".\r\n\r\n### How Do I Use MultiGather?\r\n1. Make sure you have MultiGather installed (see the above instructions).\r\n2. When you log in for the first time, you will see a red button in the middle of your screen that says \"Start Tracking\". You can drag this button wherever you like and it will remember where you placed it so it will remain there whenever MultiGather is enabled.\r\n3. Press the Start Tracking button start tracking Herbs/Minerals. There will be a 3 second delay and then the tracking will start.\r\n4. Press the button again to stop tracking.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nMultiGather was created by Pointbreak of the Dalaran-WoW Algalon server.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with MultiGather?
